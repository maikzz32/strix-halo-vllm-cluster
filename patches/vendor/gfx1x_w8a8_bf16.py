#  - The BF16 weight duplicate costs memory (2 bytes/element on top of the

#  - Env resolution must stay lazy (Ray applies worker env after import):

"""gfx1x cached-BF16 fallback for block-scaled W8A8 linear layers.

Adapted from AlexKGwyn/ds4-vllm-public. gfx1151 has no native FP8 matrix
cores, so repeatedly lowering the generic block-scaled FP8 Triton GEMM is a
poor decode path. This module dequantizes each FP8 weight to BF16 once, keeps
that copy for the process lifetime, and routes the GEMM through vLLM's ROCm
unquantized dispatcher (including its skinny-GEMM path).

The caller controls activation through VLLM_GFX1X_W8A8_BF16. The separate
VLLM_GFX1X_W8A8_BF16_DIRECT flag lets the patched linear kernel pass the
original BF16 activation directly, avoiding a lossy FP8 quantize/dequantize
round trip. Both flags are latched by the patched caller before this module is
imported and are enabled only for the DeepSeek V4 gfx1151 TP2 profile. TP1
keeps them disabled because a full-model BF16 duplicate exceeds its memory
headroom.
